# Introduction

In this report, we work with online shopping data where one observation corresponds to sessions, i.e instances of a user visiting an e-commerce website. These sessions take some time and may or may not lead to a purchase. We will fit a logistic regression model for the binary response "purchase", where we have 17 predictors available. 
The outline of the remainder of this project is as follows: We start by graphically exploring and wrangling the data. After that we use the prepared data to build a logistic regression. Finally we evaluate the performance of our final model using the Area Under Curve (AUC) criterion.
